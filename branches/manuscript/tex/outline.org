* Introduction
** Introduce Problem
*** Infectious Diseases are bad.  We want to control them.  Planning control is hard.
    Infectious diseases are a major global public health problem.
    However, controlling their spread is challenging because planning and carrying out effective interventions is difficult \cite{}.
    As a result, determining how and when to intervene is one of the major concerns of epidemiology.
    One frequently used method is to employ dynamical models to assess the behaviors of disease, including the impact of interventions, by simulation-based approaches.
    These approaches generally take a naive approach in simulating transmission dynamics, and are therefore limited in their ability to analyze the impact of interventions by their low power.
*** Counterfactuals are a method that improve upon existing methods to understand interventions.  This is what a counterfacutal is.
    In order to accurately plan and evaluate the effect of an intervention on an epidemic, we want to compare the outcomes of if we perform the intervention with the outcomes of if we do not perform the intervention.
    However, it is not possible to both intervene and not-intervene upon a single population during a single epidemic. 
    These types of questions are known as counterfactuals.
    Although in reality we are unable to both intervene and not-intervene concurrently, this is not a desirable feature for resolving counterfactual questions.
    Existing methods retain this feature, running separate simulations for interventions and non-interventions. 
    We refer to these types of counterfactuals as split simulation conterfactuals. 
*** Explain the deficiencies of existing methods
    One of the problems with split simulation counterfactuals is that outcomes of the intervention may be obfuscated by comparison across simulations. 
    This can result in seemingly impossible outcomes occurring, such as comparing a low epidemic with intervention to a high epidemic without intervention making an effective intervention appear to cause cases.
    Likewise, one could imagine an ineffective intervention that appears to work.
    As a result of these problems, the statistical power of split simulation counterfactuals is low.
*** Outline how ywe're fixing the problems in our method and set the stage for the methods (all background and information you need to understand the methods)
    Here we outline a method that addresses these problems by performing the counterfactual in a single simulation: with and without the intervention.
    To do this we have to simulate all of the events that occur with the intervention and without the intervention, as there may be events that occur in the intervention case that do not occur in the non-intervention case, and vice versa.
    Then, the effects of the intervention can be measured within a single simulation.
    Running multiple simulations provides a measure to evaluate the impacts of a proposed intervention with higher statistical power. 
* Methods
** Motivation
*** Compartmental Models
    Compartmental models are a standard in disease modeling \cite{}.
    There are a number of results where researchers perform counterfactual analysis on compartmental models \cite{}.
    There would be more results, except that the power of the standard way to do these analyses is low \cite{}.
    
** Example (Influenza)
*** SIR Model
    We use a standard short compartmental model for influenza \cite{}.
    There are compartments for susceptible, infected, and recovered.
    People move between these compartments at a rate determined by $\beta$, the force of infection, and $\gamma$ the recovery rate.
    This model is only valid for a short time scale, so we do not include births or deaths.

*** Agent Perspective
**** Why we need stochasting models
     Our goal is to eliminate process error to improve power, but so far the models described are deterministic (and therefore have no process error).
     One could say that given a deterministic model, and a deterministic intervention, the effect of the intervention falls out cleanly.
     However, deterministic models are not widely used in the field \cite{}.
     Additionally, deterministic models cannot address a main question of interest, "How well is this intervention working?"
     
**** Viewing SIR model as a stochastic model
     Our SIR model makes implicit assumptions.
     $\beta SI$ represents interactions between susceptible and infected individuals.
     $\gamma I$ represents the probability of recovery.
     Our deterministic differential equation is actually the expectation of a stochastic process.
     Something something population size
     $\beta SI$ is ...
     $\gamma I$ is the expectation of a binomial distribution.

**** Agent Based Versions
     Instead of modeling the number of susceptibles, infected, and recovered, we want to switch and model the state of each person in our population.
     We do this, because it works.
     Instead of a vector of the number of people in each compartment, we use a vector of the state of each person.
     Each susceptible person has a $\frac{\beta}{N}$ probability of becoming infected by each infected person at each time step.
     Each infected person has a $\gamma$ probability of recovering at each time step.
     
*** Simulating and Pruning
**** Conditional Probabilities
     We know the probability that a person recovers given that they are infected is $\gamma$.
     We know the probability that a person infects another person given that the first is susceptible and the second is infected is $\frac{\beta}{N}$.
     We can simulate from these distributions without knowing if the conditionals are satisfied.
     This is helpful, since we won't know a priori what the intervention affects and doesn't.
     To simulate, we draw uniformly randomly from $[0,1]$, and compare that to the probability.
     If the random draw is less than the probability, it happens.
     Otherwise, it does not happen.
     
**** Simulate all possible events
     We could account for every possible intervention by simulating every relevent conditional probability.
     Given a population size $N$, and number of time steps $T$, there are a finite number of things to simulate.
     For each time step, we need to simulate $N$ recovery probabilities, and $N^2$ infection probabilities.
     In total, we would need to simulate $N(N+1)T$ numbers.
     For a population of $4$ million, and daily time steps for a year, that would take almost $6$ million gigabytes of storage. %(4000000 * 4000001 * 365) * bytes = 5840001.46 gigabytes
     More complicated models with more compartments would take even more space.

**** Pruning simulated events
     For many interventions, not all simulations are necessary.
     By making some assumptions about the interventions, we can reduce the amount we need to store.
     We assume that the intervention can only increase the probability of infection.
