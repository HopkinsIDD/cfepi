\section{Introduction}
Dynamic models are frequently used to assess the likely impact of disease control strategies.
These exercises range from modeling the impact of a new intervention or strategy on an established pathogen [CITE], to models of the containment and control of emergent epidemics \cite{lessler-et-al:2016}.
While deterministic models are frequently used \cite{fraser-et-al:2004}, stochastic simulations are increasingly common as they can account for both uncertainty in the underlying parameters and the random nature of the disease process \cite{ferguson-et-al:2003}.
In both stochastic and deterministic models, the impact of interventions are typically determined by comparison of simulations with and without the intervention.

In the deterministic setting, this comparison is straight forward, as with a given set of parameters and starting conditions the epidemic will always behave exactly the same; hence any comparison between an intervention scenario and its non-intervention ‘counterfactual’ can only be attributed to the intervention itself.
When stochastic models are used, things become more complicated.
Typically, two sets of simulations are conducted, one with the intervention and one without, and then the distribution of outcomes from the two sets are compared to estimate the intervention effect.
Because these are independent sets of simulations, there may be some simulations in the non-intervention scenario where the disease dies off quickly due to random chance, and fewer cases occur than the majority of intervention simulations.
Likewise, there may be cases in the intervention scenario where large numbers are infected through sheer ‘bad luck’ for the virtual populations involved.
If these stochastic effects are large, they may lead uncertainty intervals in effect estimates to include the intervention having no effect, or even a negative impact, even if the intervention is modeled in such a way that it can only have a beneficial effect.
For example, the results of a study of measles vaccination strategies by Lessler et al. appears to leave open the possibility that more cases of measles could occur in a country if supplementary vaccination activities were conducted than if those campaigns had not occurred.
Likewise, Rivers et al. appears to leave open the possibility that more cases of Ebola could occur in a country if pharmaceuticals were introduced to help patient survivability than if no pharmaeuticals were introduced.
% Potentially find one more example.
These effects will be exacerbated if the processes being modeled are complex or we are simultaneously sampling over parameter uncertainty.

The results of this approach have a very specific interpretation: they represent the difference between what we expect to be observed in an uncontrolled epidemic compared to a completely independent epidemic where the intervention occurred (conditional on the starting conditions).
However, what we often want to know is what would have happen had the intervention occurred in the exact same epidemic.
This is equivalent to the problem of counterfactual inference in randomized trials and observational studies, where we take one set of individuals (or populations) as a stand in for what would have happened in another in the counterfactual situation that they had experienced some exposure.
A number of techniques of trial design and statistical analysis have been developed to help such real world studies better approximate the true counterfactual situation (\cite{hudgens-halloran:2008,murray-et-al:2017,buchanan:2014} are just a few examples of the large literature on the subject). %Potentially find another reference than the dissertation
However, in computational simulations it is possible to take a more exact approach.

Here, we present a method for simulation of direct counterfactuals to stochastic simulations using principles borrowed from the percolation approach to epidemic simulation \cite{miller-book}.
We illustrate this ‘single-world’ approach using simulations of interventions against an influenza like illness, and outline how the general approach can be adapted to a wide variety of disease systems and simulation methodologies.

\section{Methods}
\subsection*{Overall Approach}
%% Key points
Our proposed method separates modeling the epidemic and the intervention so we can apply them sequentially ensuring the intervention and non-intervention results come from the same epidemic.
In order to separate the epidemic from the intervention, we need to model events that occur in the intervention case, but not the non-intervention case, and vice versa.
Because some of the events we model will not happen in at least one case, any appropriate modeling approach must consider potential events rather than actual events.

%% Graph
Our approach begins with an implicit set of all possible events, which we think of as a large graph where each edge is an event, and each node is a person at a time. %The model implies this
We call this graph the complete graph
The underlying epidemic model assigns each event (edge) a probability of occuring conditional on the states of people at the previous time for any potential intervention.
We could stochastically determine whether each event occurs under those same conditions with and without the intervention, removing those events which do not occur.
We call the remaining graph the epidemic potential graph.
We can then apply initial conditions to determine which edges actually occur, and the state of each person at each time.
We call this graph the realized epidemic graph.

%% Pruning
If the above approach were computationally feasible, we would apply it and be finished.
However the method is intractable except in small populations for simple models (more detail in results).
By making assumptions about the way interventions work, we are able to prune enough potential events for the problem to become tractable.

\subsection*{General Framework}
We define a general compartmental model as a system of difference equations with $K$ compartments governed by 
\begin{align*}
\Delta x_{j} &= \sum_{i \neq j} \alpha_{i,j}x_i + \sum_{i \neq j, k} \alpha_{i,j,k} x_ix_k.
\end{align*}
We can interpret $\alpha_{i,j} > 0$ as the probability a person transitions to state $j$ conditional on being in state $i$, and $\alpha_{i,j,k} > 0$ as the probability that a person transitions to state $j$ conditional on being in state $i$ another specific person being in state $k$.
Then, these $\alpha_{i,j}$ and $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ each represent a type of event corresponding to several edges in the graph: $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ edges connect a person at one time to a different person at the next time, and $\alpha_{i,j}$ edges connect a person at one time to the same person at the next time.
Each person also has the potential to be in each of the $K$ compartments at each time, and we use the nodes of our graph to keep track of this.
%%%% Explanation of how we make edges out of them probably seems right about now.

%% Pruning Overview
To construct the epidemic potential graph, we prune the complete graph by applying three steps at each time: we prune events that deterministically cannot occur; we stochastically prune the remaining events according to the model; and we eliminate potential states from the nodes according to our assumptions (Figure \ref{fig:pruning}).
If we make no assumptions about pruning, then this collapses back to the method presented in the overview and any potential intervention is allowed.
If we assume that each node only has one potential state, its actual state, then this method collapses back to the compartmental model presented above and no intervention is allowed.
We want assumptions general enough to admit interventions of interest, but not so general the problem becomes intractable.

%% FIGURE 1
\begin{figure}[hp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/figure6.pdf}
\caption{\textit{‘Single-world’ simulation process.}
  To simulate an initial epidemic and interventions, we start with a (implicit) graph where each node represents the possible states a person at particular time in the epidemic and edges represent possible events that can change a nodes state (a).
  In the above example, a person can be susceptible (purple pie slice), infectious (orange) or immune (green), and the possible events are infection (orange arrows) and recovery (green arrows).
  We start by assigning each individual in the population a state at time 0 (b), here infecting person 1.
  We next remove all edges that are deterministically impossible based on the initial state (c).
  We then prune those edges stochastically selected not to occur by our underlying infection model (d).
  The possible states of each person for time 1 based on the edges still existing in the graph, so each person’s set of potential states encompasses those that could exist if each of the previous set of events did or did not exist (e).
  We now repeat steps c-e for events between time 1 and time 2 (f-h), and times 2 and 3 (i-k) and so on.
  Note that when we prune the edges between steps 1 and 2 (i) we still keep the those for persons 1 and 2 infecting person 3, even though person 3 has already been infected, because susceptibility is still a possible state for person 3 at time 2 in an intervention scenario (i.e., elimination of event edges could lead to a scenario where person 3 is susceptible at time 2).
  This final [potential epidemic] graph can then be used to obtain simulated epidemics with and without interventions (see Figure \ref{fig:actualizing}).
}
\label{fig:pruning}
\end{figure}

%% Pruning assumptions
When pruning we assume that interventions do not add any events to the graph, do not alter the initial conditions, and do not remove events associated with $\alpha_{i,j}$ from the graph.
As stated, these assumptions are too strong, and prevent many standard interventions (vaccination, for example, adds transitions to a vaccinated compartment).
We \emph{only} use these assumptions to say eventst deterministically cannot happen, and so we only need them to hold to the extent that they remove edges from the graph.
Adding a transition to a state that a person never leaves, or a state that was otherwise among their potential states does not cause any new events to be deterministically impossible.

To construct the realized epidemic graph from the epidemic potential graph, we prune the epidemic potential graph by applying three steps at each time: we prune events that did not occur, we stochastically determine if the intervention removes any events; and we determine the actual state of each person (Figure \ref{fig:acutalizing}).
The intervention plays two roles here, both preventing some events from happening in step $2$, and altering the states of individuals directly in step $3$.
Altering the states of individuals is equivalent to adding new events to the graph, and therefore restricted by our assumptions above.

%% FIGURE 1
\begin{figure}[hp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/figure10.pdf}
\caption{\textit{‘Single-world’ simulation process (continued).}
  To obtain a simulated epidemic including a potential intervention, we start with a potential epidemic graph (a) (see Figure \ref{fig:pruning} for how to create a epidemic potential graph).
  In the above example, a person can be susceptible (purple pie slice), infectious (orange) or immune (green), and the possible events are infection (orange arrows) and recovery (green arrows). %Potentially remove this
  There is only one possible state at time $0$, so we set the true state of each node to that possible state (b).
  We next remove all edges that are impossible based on the actual state (c). %This will never actually do anything, so could remove
  We then prune those edges stochastically selected not to occur by our underlying intervention model (d).
  The actual state of each person for time $1$ is the the color of any incoming edges, or its previous state if there are no incoming edges.
  We also allow the intervention to change the actual state of any node at this stage (e).
  We now repeat steps c-e for events between time 1 and time 2 (f-h), and times 2 and 3 (i-k) and so on.
  This final [epidemic] graph can be used to extract our outcome of interest.
  Any epidemic graphs made from the same epidemic potential graph represent the results of different interventions in a `single-world'.
}
\label{fig:actualizing}
\end{figure}

At this stage, we also need to account for the possibility of two conflicting events occuring (e.g. a person may become infected and grow older in an age cohort model).
In some cases the events interact (the person grows older and is infected), in other cases one event takes precedence over the other (a person who dies and gets infected is dead).
It is up to the modeler to account for these cases, and determine what should happen.

\subsection*{Influenza Example}
To demonstrate single-world inference, we construct an influenza example using a standard Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Immune (R) compartmental model.
By modeling influenza transmission within a single season we do not account for loss of immunity and we assume that births and deaths are negligible.
We allow the probability of an infectious contact between any particular susceptible-infected pair to be $\beta = 0.78$ per day and the probability of an infected individual recovering at any time step to be $\gamma = 0.44$ per day \cite{forsberg-white-et-al:2009}.


We use these networks for figures and computation, but when we discuss them we will use more natural language.
Instead of saying that there is a conditional tranmission edge between person $i$ at time $t$ and person $j$ at time $t+1$, we will say that person $i$ could transmit to person $j$ at time $t$.
Instead of saying that there is a conditional recovery edge between person $i$ at time $t$ and person $i$ at time $t+1$, we will say that person $i$ could recover at time $t$.

Without any information about the epidemic or intervention we can say almost nothing: each person is potentially infectious, potentially susceptible, and potentially removed at every time.
Additionally, each person could recover at any time, and each person could transmit to any other person at any time.
We call the network that contains all of these possibilities the complete network (Figure \ref{fig:outline} a)).

From the the complete network, we begin pruning.
Starting at time $0$, we do three things at each time step: determine the potential states of each person, determine the potential transmissions and recoveries, and evaluate potential transmissions and recoveries using the SIR model.
These steps are phrased positively, but we should actually think of this process as using additional information about the epidemic to rule out parts of the complete network.
In the first step, we eliminate node states, in the second step we eliminate edges, and in the third we get new information about the epidemic (Figure \ref{fig:pruning}).

To determine the potential states of each person, we look at their potential states at the last time step, whether they could have recovered, and whether another person could have transmitted to them.
We then use our knowledge about the model and the intervention to eliminate possible states.
Our initial conditions tell us that we can eliminate all but one state at time $0$.
No one becomes susceptible, so a person cannot be susceptible if they were not susceptible at the previous time step. %This is still confusing.
Only infected people can become removed, so a person is not removed if they could not have been infected nor removed at the previous time step.
Only people who are transmitted to become infected, so a person is not infected if they were not previously infected and there are no potential transmissions to them.
More than that, we know that no intervention prevents recovery, so any potential recoveries at the previous time step will happen if their conditions are met.
This means a person potentially infected at the previous time will not remain infected if there is a potential recovery.
We say that a person is not infected if they potentially recovered and there are not potential transmissions to them at the previous time step.
We could potentially make other observations that would allow us to prune more nodes, but these are all we prune in this case.
We discuss these observations more thoroughly in the general method.

With information about the current state of each person, we can eliminate potential transmissions and potential recoveries (e.g. a person cannot recover if they could not have been infected).
We then remove those edges.
We know that someone who cannot be infected does not transmit disease.
We know that someone who cannot be susceptible cannot have disease transmitted to them.
We know that someone who is not infected cannot recover.

At this stage, we need more information from the SIR model to proceed.
Transmissions are part of the epidemic with probability $\beta$; recoveries are part of the epidemic with probability $\gamma$.
Of all of the potential transmissions and recoveries, we eliminate them with the appropriate probability.
We then repeat all three steps for each time step.
The result is a network we a the potential network (Figure \ref{fig:outline} b)).

Now that we have the pruned network, applying our intervention is fairly straightforward.
We repeat the pruning procedure with one difference: instead of consulting the SIR model for information, we consult the intervention model.
This process modifies the potential network into a second potential network containin information from both the intervention and the SIR model (Figure \ref{fig:outline} b${}^*$)).
We could even, if we wanted to, apply another intervention on top of the first one, resulting in a potential network representing two interventions at the same time.

After we have applied any interventions we want, we need to actualize the network so that it represents actual states and events instead of potential ones.
Actualizing the network is very similar to the pruning process: we update the states of the nodes, and remove inconsistent edges.
Starting at time $0$, we set the state of each person to their initial state.
We then assume every potential transmission or recovery at time $0$ actually happens, which tells us everyone's state at time $1$.
This will make some transmissions and recoveries at time $1$ inconsistent (e.g. a recovered person transmitting to someone), so we remove those states.
We repeat this process for each time and obtain an actualized network (Figure \ref{fig:outline} c) and c${}^*$)).

This new network is similar to a transmission tree, as it contains all of the events as they happen in time.
In fact if we remove every recovery edge and any disconnected nodes, then this new newtork is a transmission tree.
Therefore it can be used to determine the course of the epidemic.
It is important to note that the intervention is applied after the SIR model has pruned the network.
Indeed, as long as we have the potential network, it can be used multiple times for different interventions.

We evaluate the effects of four control measures on influenza cases averted: hand-washing, vaccination, antivirals, and a null intervention.
We selected these example interventions to highlight different ways in which interventions can interact with single-world inference.
We assume that for hand-washing, everyone washes their hands and that it reduces the transmissibility of influenza by $1\%$.
For vaccination intervention, we choose $25\%$ of people to be vaccinated at the beginning of the season and assume it fully protects $33\%$ of those vaccinated
For the antiviral intervention, we choose $25\%$ of people to take antivirals when they first become infected, assume that it reduces their average duration of infection by $0.7$ days \cite{oseltamivir:2014}, and model this reduction in duration of infection as an additional $36.1\%$ chance of recovering at each time step.
To highlight the differences between single-world and multiple-world inference, we include a null intervention in which we do not intervene.
While this is not an intervention, it effectively demonstrates the ability of our method to reduce the process model variance.
We run $1,000$ simulations of each type of inference, for each intervention, on a population of $4,000$ for $100$ days and calculate the estimated number of cases averted.

\subsection{General Framework}\label{subsection:general}

We extend the single-world inference example to a general class of compartmental models and generic interventions by outlining the differences between the general method and the influenza example.
We define these as a system of difference equations with $K$ compartments governed by 
\begin{align*}
\Delta x_{j} &= \sum_{i \neq j} \alpha_{i,j}x_i + \sum_{i \neq j, k} \alpha_{i,j,k} x_ix_k.
\end{align*}
Where $\alpha_{i,j}$ is the probability that a person transitions from state $i$ to state $j$, and $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ is the probability that a person transitions from state $i$ to state $j$ after contacting with an individual in state $k$.
Each transition is represented both as entering a compartment $\alpha > 0$, and leaving a compartment $\alpha < 0$.
Since we are only interested in people entering new states, we only track positive values of $\alpha$.
We can rephrase our influenza example in these new terms where
\begin{align*}
    x_1 &= S, \\
    x_2 &= I, \\
    x_3 &= R,
\end{align*}
$\alpha_{2,1,2} = \beta $, and $\alpha_{3,2} = \gamma$ all other $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ and $\alpha_{i,j}$ are equal to $0$.

We still use a network with a node representing each person at each time.
The nodes still have multiple potential states, but now they are $x_1 \dots x_K$ instead of $S$, $I$, and $R$.
For each positive $\alpha_{i,j,k} $ and $\alpha_{i,j}$, we have a different type of edge.
Since $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ edges represent contacts, we connect each person at each time to every other person at the next time.
We call this type of edges interaction edges.
Since $\alpha_{i,j}$ edges represent spontaneous transitions, we connect each person at each time to themselves at the next time.
We call this type of edges transition edges.
For either category of edge, we call $i$ the from state and $j$ the to state.
Unlike in the influenza example, there may be multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes.

We prune the network using the same three steps at each time step: determine potential states, determine potential edges, and consult the model for more information.
While the steps are the same, some of the reasoning needs to be generalized.
We need to generalize the assumptions that allow us to update the potential states of the nodes.
Once we generalize those assumptions, we will use them to generate rules for eliminating potential states.
We also need to generalize the edge elimination process for steps two and three.

We make two assumptions about interventions in the general case.
To state these assumptions, we first need two definitions.
A compartment $i$ is terminal if no one leaves that compartment ($\alpha_{i,j,k},\alpha_{i,j} \leq 0$ for all $j,k$).
In the influenza example, the recovered compartment is terminal.
An edge is redundant if its to state is terminal, or if it does not alter the potential state of any node.
Our first assumption is that an intervention does not add edges that are not redundant.
Our second assumption is that an intervention does not remove transition edges that are not redundant.
These assumptions are more restrictive in the general case than the SIR case, but still include most common interventions.

Using these assumptions about the intervention, we can use the following pruning rules.
A person is not in a compartment if they were not potentially in that compartment at the previous time, and could not have entered that compartment.
A person is not in a compartment if they would have left a compartment at the previous time if they were in it, and could not have entered the compartment.

We group the changes to both edge pruning steps together.
We can eliminate an interaction edge associated with $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ if $i$ is not a potential state of the source person.
We can eliminate an interaction edge associated with $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ if $k$ is not a potential state of the target person.
We can eliminate an interaction edge associated with $\alpha_{i,j}$ if $i$ is not a potential state of the person.
When consulting the model, we keep an edge with probability of the associated $\alpha_{i,j}$ or $\alpha_{i,j,k}$.
Once we have completed the three steps at each time step, we have our potential network.
We can do our second pruning to account for our intervention in the same way as the influenza example.

Our last step is to actualize the network.
Unlike in the influenza case, it is now possible that two different edges affect the same person at the same time, changing their state to two different states.
As an example, in an age cohort model, a susceptible child might be infected, and become an adult the same time step.
Unfortunately, there are many ways to handle this type of conflict, and the right way depends on the model.
In the age case, the correct answer is that both events happen, the susceptible child becomes an infected adult.
In a different case, the answer may be to choose randomly between the two events, or that one of the events takes priority over the other (a dead adult is just dead for example).

\caption{Time series showing the number of cases averted at each time caused by the intervention calculated using single-world inference and multiple-world inference.  We observe that single-world inference performs how you would expect the interventios to perform; cases prevented are almost always positive, and many of the cases prevented stay prevented (though not all). On the other hand, multiple-world inference generally has a very different shape, apparently possibly causing a large number of cases in the middle of the epidemic, and a lot of uncertainty surrounding the peak of the epidemic.}

We define and demonstrate single-world inference and apply it to determining the impact of three interventions on the number of cases averted.
We compare the outcomes of single-world inference to multiple-world inference.
We find that single-world inference generally has the same point estimates as multiple-world inference, but with narrower confidence intervals.
We also see that multiple-world inference has some nonsensical results that single-world inference avoids.

For single-world inference, we found that every non-null intervention had a significant ($p<0.05$) number of cases averted: Null $ 0 $ (CI $ 0 $ \textemdash $ 0 $), Antivirals $ 819.125 $ (CI $ 206 $ \textemdash $ 2900 $), Social Distancing $ 153.594 $ (CI $ 12 $ \textemdash $ 298 $), Vaccination $ 284.955 $ (CI $ 130 $ \textemdash $ 438 $).
For multiple-world inference, we found that every all but one non-null intervention had a significant ($p<0.05$) number of cases averted: Null $ \neg4.94 $ (CI $ \neg196 $ \textemdash $ 184 $), Antivirals $ 814.185 $ (CI $ 176 $ \textemdash $ 2914 $), Social Distancing $ 148.654 $ (CI $ \neg70 $ \textemdash $ 356 $), Vaccination $ 280.015 $ (CI $ 72 $ \textemdash $ 500 $).
In addition to estimates of cases averted, we observe that multiple-world has an unintuitive effect on the shape of the epidemic (Figure \ref{fig:epicurve}).

We released a software package, \texttt{counterfactual}, on \texttt{CRAN}, %NOTE: This is not true yet
which implements single-world inference as described the methods section.
It follows the assumptions and procedures outlined above, but does not enforce those assumptions, or deal with conflicting state changes.
The amount of space and time pruning takes in the software package is $\mathcal O(E)$, where $E[O(E)]$ which is on average $O(t(n^2\sum \alpha_{i,j,k} + n \sum\alpha_{i,j}))$ per simulation, or $O(t(n^2\beta + n\gamma))$ in the case of the SIR model.
The amount of time the interventions take is also $\mathcal O(E)$, but the constant is lower (Table \ref{table:performance}).
This shows us that the number of infectious compartments, the population, number of times, and number of simulations all impact the amount of time taken, but population has the biggest impact.

\section{Discussion}
In this paper, we present a method that can reduce uncertainty and variability in the underlying process model to reflect variability only in the intervention itself.
We demonstrate the ability of our method to factor away inter-epidemic variation via simulation and show that through precise simulation, our method avoids the issue of counterintuitive results. 
Additionally, our method is tractable when applied to a broad class of models and interventions, simultaneously: most of which are supported by our software package.

Inherently, our method sets out to address a different question than most simulation-based methods. 
Traditional methods simulate two completely independent epidemics in the same population, from the same parameters, with one epidemic intervened upon while the other is not. 
These address important policy questions: if you were to see another epidemic in the same population, what would the impact of an intervention look like on that epidemic. 
While the questions that traditional simulation-based method can address are vitally important, our method sets out to address a more precise question. 
Given two precisely identical epidemics what is the effect of the intervention. 
This method precisely isolates the expected intervention impact which allows for a better comparison of interventions or a better understanding of the true differences between control programs.

Even at asking this different question, single-world inference has some inherent limitations.
Discrete time compartmental models are not cutting edge modeling techniques.
Our method is discrete time, but Gillespie algorithms would allow it to be extended into continuous time.
Our method considers compartmental models, but it could be extended to network or agent based models.
Extending the method in the above ways is non-trivial, even if we know the general way to proceed.

On the other hand, there are limitations caused by our assumptions about interventions that provide no clear path forward
Some reasonable interventions do not follow the assumptions about interventions outlined above in the general method.
Even if the intervention does follow our assumptions, the potential network may still be computationally intractable to store for complex models, large populations, or long times.
While we can address this concern for a particular intervention, the stronger assumptions we make, the less interventions follow them.
Worse, even if we ignore tractability some interventions are beyond the scope of this method.
We need to express the intervention in a way that the potential network captures, so if an intervention is too radical of a change, there is nothing we can do.

Going forward, an important extension of the work at the intersection of of computer science and epidemiology is to improve upon this method such that it remains logically consistent with fewer storage requirements. 
Interesting work remains to be done to improve our ability to make inference without continuing to significantly increase the computational power needed.
We have developed a method for utilizing computational power to address more a precise counterfactual question about interventions. 
Single-world inference allows us to more precisely understand the effects of interventions within the context of a single outbreak. 
With precise understanding, we can better determine when an intervention is effective, and when it is spurious.
Single-world inference also allows us to better compare interventions, and aids in choosing the best intervention from many possibilities. 
Single-world inference also mark a new way of leveraging computational resources to solve epidemiological problems.
