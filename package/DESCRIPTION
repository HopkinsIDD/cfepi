Description: Simulate compartmental infectious disease models both with and without control strategies within a single simulation.  'cfepi' also allows users to determine the relative effects of control strategies without including additional variance introduced by cross-simulation sampling.  More details available in Kaminsky et al: <doi:10.1101/451153>.
